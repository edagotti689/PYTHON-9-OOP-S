'''
1. All name variables and methods are public by default in Python
2. Protected variable we can define By prefixing the name of your variable or method with a single underscore, you’re telling others “don’t touch this, unless you’re a subclass”
3. private variable we can define By prefixing the name of your variable with a double underscore,
4. By declaring your data member private you mean, that nobody should be able to access it from outside the class.
